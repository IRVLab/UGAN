# Underwater GAN (UGAN)

### [[Project Page]](http://irvlab.cs.umn.edu/enhancing-underwater-imagery-using-generative-adversarial-networks) [[arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.04011.pdf) [[Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgTHleu9L0U)

Image enhancement for underwater vision. This project uses CycleGAN to perform style transfer on "clean" underwater
photos to appear to be underwater.

We used [this video from Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmRFmhILd5o) as our distorted domain, and
hand picked images from Imagenet for our "clean" domain. CycleGAN was used to distort clean images to provide
us a dataset.
